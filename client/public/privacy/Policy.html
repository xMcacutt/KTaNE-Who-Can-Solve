                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>KTaNE - Who Can Solve?</strong> is a community-driven project designed
                    to store and display player confidence scores for each module in modded <em>Keep
                        Talking and Nobody Explodes</em>.
                    This website uses Discord OAuth for user authentication and stores limited,
                    non-sensitive identifying information in a secure database.
                    This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected, how it is used, how
                    it
                    is stored, and your rights regarding that information.
                </p>

                <h3>Data Collection</h3>
                <p>
                    When you sign in using Discord OAuth, your Discord username, user ID, and avatar
                    hash are collected and stored.
                    This data is used solely to identify you within the site, to display your name
                    and avatar on leaderboards and your account page, and to generate in-game
                    profile names containing your username and ID.
                    This identifying information is not used for any other purpose and is not shared
                    with any third parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When interacting with the site, your module confidence scores, bomb favourites,
                    and solo statuses may be collected and stored.
                    This data is displayed publicly through leaderboards and may be accessed via the
                    in-game companion mod or route.
                    It may also be used to generate anonymised statistics or insights to improve the
                    site.
                    This information will never be sold, licensed, or shared outside the scope of
                    the site.
                </p>

                <p>
